### Original Commit

Please do original work on `master`.  The `master` branch is for the
latest stable branch of Scala, e.g. 2.9.Z where Z is the patch version
number.  Your commit should work with all Scala patch versions.

### Merge Commit For Older Scala Versions

We maintain `scala-X.Y` branches for older stable Scala versions.

At all times we support the current stable and previous stable Scala
branches, e.g. 2.9.Z and 2.8.Z, so at a minimum merge your change from
`master` to the branch for the previous stable Scala branch.

We do this as a benefit for the community to add features for older
Scala versions.  Additionally, Sony Pictures Imageworks doesn't have
the cycles to immediately upgrade to the latest Scala version, so for
selfish reasons, we would like it merged back ;)

### Test Before Submitting Pull Request

##### Testing On a Branch Using sbt

If you are on a branch that uses sbt, please run the unit tests on all
the Scala versions that the branch supports by using `sbt "+ test"`.
For example, the `scala-2.8` branch supports 2.8.0, 2.8.1 and 2.8.2,
so all three versions would need to be tested.

We request this since sometimes changes are made to Scala that break
the build on a specific patch version.  If the build does break then
the pull request will not be accepted because we do a separate release
for each Scala patch version.

##### Testing On a Branch Using ant

For the `scala-2.7` branch, testing with Scala 2.7.7 is sufficient.

### Build and Test Commands

##### Scala 2.8 and Above

The `master` and `scala-X.Y` branches for X.Y >= 2.8 use sbt to build,
run unit tests, and package Scala Migrations.  Find sbt at
http://www.scala-sbt.org/ .

* Install sbt
  * http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html
* To build: sbt compile
* To test with the highest Scala version supported by the branch: sbt test
* To test with all Scala versions supported by the branch: sbt "+ test"
* To package all versions (instead of just one): sbt "+ package"
* To generate IntelliJ project: sbt gen-idea

##### Scala 2.7

The `scala-2.7` branch uses ant to build, run unit tests and package
Scala Migrations.

* Install ant
* To build: ant compile
* To test: ant test
* To package: ant
